# StarDict to DSL dictionary converter

Converts **StarDict** dictionaries to text files in **DSL** markup format.  
Based on the [stardict-3](https://github.com/huzheng001/stardict-3) project.

## Usage
`stardict_to_dsl "c:\latin-english.ifo"` - will create **"c:\latin-english.dsl"** dictionary file

## Notes
- If you have a **\*.dict.dz** file for your dictionary, unpack it so the **.dict** file is accessible directly to the script
